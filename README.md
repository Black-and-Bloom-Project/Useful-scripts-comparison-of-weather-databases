# Comparison of weather data from different weather monitoring stations (namely, Promice, S6 and B&B from Greenland)

Version of this script: v7 (last update: 05/12/2020)

Author: Nuno Canha

# Goal of the script: 
This script aims to combine 3 different weather datasets (with the parameters: dataset, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction) and compare them using plots and spearman correlations.

This script uses datasets of three weather stations located at Greenland (S6, KAN_M and B&B). 
The input files should be "csv" type, with hourly values (pre-treatment should be done if needed).

Updates of current version:
Timestamps of the input files were corrected to match
